*The Strategy Pattern* defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one,  
and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary iindependently from
clients that use it.


Encapsulate things that changes it their own classes, using an interface or superclass for abstraction  
then use composition (has-a) to put them in the desired class as instance variables  
you can use setter methods to change the behavior on runtime
